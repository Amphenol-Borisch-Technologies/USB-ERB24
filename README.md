USB-ERB24 is a TradeMark of Measurement Computing Corporation.

Part of TestExecutive, listed separately as it might be of use elsewhere, and too obscure in TestExecutive to be noticeable.
Latest/greatest code will likely be in TestExecutive though; https://github.com/Amphenol-Borisch-Technologies/TestExecutive.
